# Learning Functional Programming in ES6

### By Shaun Wassell

The course provides a basic introduction into functional programming in ES6.

A lot of the material was already very familiar to me, and as such for the purposes of this repository I have picked out just a few of the challenges and sections of the course that I found of interest.

I have very much gone off piste from the given material practicing and refactoring with more advanced functional techniques.

These include incorporating recursion, monads, piping and currying into my solutions.

I am really enjoying my learning path in to functional programming and there is some great material out there by the likes of *Brian Lonsdorf*, *Federico Kereki* and *Kyle Simpson* â€” to name a few.

I just love the mindset behind this clean, pure and declarative style of programming.
